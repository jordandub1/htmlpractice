    <h2>Bio:</h2>
        <p>"Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor (born 7 November 1996), known professionally as Lorde, is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. 
            Taking inspiration from aristocracy for her stage name, she is known for employing unconventional musical styles and 
            introspective songwriting. Lorde's music is primarily electropop and contains elements of subgenres such as dream pop 
            and indie-electro.<br><br>

            Born in the Auckland suburb of Takapuna and raised in neighbouring Devonport, Lorde expressed interest in performing 
            at local venues in her early teens. She signed with Universal Music Group (UMG) in 2009 and collaborated with producer 
            Joel Little in 2011 to start recording material. Initially self-released in 2012 for free download on SoundCloud, UMG 
            commercially released the pair's first collaborative effort, an extended play (EP) titled The Love Club, in 2013. 
            The EP's international chart-topping single "Royals" helped Lorde rise to prominence.<br><br>
            
            Her debut studio album Pure Heroine was released that same year to critical and commercial success. The following year, 
            Lorde curated the soundtrack for the 2014 film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay â€“ Part 1 and recorded several tracks, 
            including the single "Yellow Flicker Beat". Her second studio album Melodrama (2017) received widespread critical 
            acclaim and debuted atop the US Billboard 200.<br><br>
            
            Lorde's accolades include two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, and a Golden Globe nomination. She appeared in Time's 
            list of the most influential teenagers in 2013 and 2014, and the 2014 edition of Forbes 30 Under 30. In addition to 
            her solo work, she has co-written songs for other artists, including Broods and Bleachers. As of June 2017, Lorde 
            has sold over five million albums worldwide." Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde">Wikipedia</a>
